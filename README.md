# The-Elliptical-Integral-and-the-Large-Angle-Pendulum

After conducting an experimental and computational study of the large-angle pendulum, I discovered that the solutions involved elliptical integrals. This sparked my interest, and during math class, I decided to write a report on this topic for my math internal assessment.

The report begins by outlining the behavior of a pendulum, particularly focusing on the period of oscillation under small-angle approximations. It discusses how, at small angles, the pendulum's period is independent of the initial angle. I then delve into the dynamics of pendulum motion at larger angles, demonstrating that the period becomes dependent on elliptic integrals. The proof involves deriving the equation of motion using energy conservation principles, emphasizing that the gravitational potential energy of the pendulum bob converts into kinetic energy as it swings.

The period for large angles is expressed in terms of an elliptic integral of the first kind, showcasing that unlike small angles, the period varies significantly with the initial angle. The report rigorously proves that the complete elliptic integral can be expressed as an infinite series. This series representation facilitates accurate calculations of the pendulum's period for larger angles, enhancing understanding of pendulum dynamics.

The CODE.PDF includes a section that describes a Python program developed to compute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. The program uses a series expansion method to approximate the integral, allowing for high accuracy in calculating K(k) for different initial angles. The algorithm initializes coefficients for the numerator and denominator, calculates the elliptic modulus, and iteratively computes the coefficients for the series expansion within a loop. This approach allows the program to sum thousands of terms in the series, yielding reliable approximations of the period for a large-angle pendulum.

Graphical representations of the results generated by the program are also provided, comparing the computed values of K(k) with numerical results obtained using the Desmos program. This comparison highlights the convergence behavior of the series and reinforces the insights drawn from the mathematical analysis. The detailed explanations of the code and its purpose underscore the importance of numerical methods in studying complex physical phenomena, particularly in the context of large-angle pendulum dynamics.
